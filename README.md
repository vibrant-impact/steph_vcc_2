A comprehensive, single-element CSS shape library designed for modern UI/UX development. This repository serves as a practical resource for developers looking for lightweight, performant geometric patterns and icons without the need for SVG or image assets.

## 🚀 The Vision
As a graphic design graduate transitioning into web development and AI, I created this library to bridge the gap between complex visual design and clean, maintainable code. 

## ✨ Key Features
* **Single Element:** Every shape is rendered using a single HTML `<div>`.
* **Zero Dependencies:** No frameworks or external libraries required.
* **Modern CSS:** Utilizes `aspect-ratio`, `mask-image`, and CSS variables.
* **Interactive Explorer:** Click any shape to view its specific CSS implementation.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
The project follows a strict development workflow:
* **Branching Strategy:** Feature-based branching for all updates.
* **Coding Standard:** Clean `camelCase` naming conventions for all JavaScript and custom CSS utility classes.
* **Structure:** - `index.html`: The interactive gallery layout.
  - `app.css`: The shape engine containing all geometric logic.
  - `app.js`: The code-display interaction logic.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Browse the library and click on a shape you like.
2. The CSS code will appear in the display at the bottom of the page.
3. Click **Copy CSS** and paste it into your own stylesheet.
4. Ensure your project uses `box-sizing: border-box` for the most accurate rendering.
